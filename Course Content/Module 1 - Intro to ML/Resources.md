## Chapter 5 of MLY - "Your development and test sets"
1. Training set — Which you run your learning algorithm on.
1. Dev (development) set — Which you use to tune parameters, select features, and make other decisions regarding the learning algorithm. Sometimes also called the hold-out cross validation set.
1. Test set — which you use to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, but not to make
any decisions regarding what learning algorithm or parameters to use.
