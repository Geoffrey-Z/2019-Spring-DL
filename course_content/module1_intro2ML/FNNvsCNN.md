Densely connected Neural Networks vs Convolutional neural networks  

Coca-cola ad - Hulk vs Antman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMkGwCw7iv8 (size corresponds to the number of parameters/connections)

A convolutional neuron does what a lifeguard does at a pool.
He scans the poolâ€™s surface creating an output map (that is exactly what convolution does)
One lifeguard looking who knows the relationship between light reflections and drowning
Another lifeguard who knows the relationship between the body size and drowning
Another lifeguard who knows the relationship between the water splashing and drowning
