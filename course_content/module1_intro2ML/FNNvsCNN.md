##Densely connected Neural Networks vs Convolutional neural networks  
One is like a hulk and the other is like an ant-man

What exactly is a convolutional neuron?
How easy is the job of a lifeguard in a pool?
He scans the poolâ€™s surface creating an output map (that is exactly what convolution does)
Imagine:
one lifeguard looking who knows the relationship between light reflections and drowning
Another lifeguard who knows the relationship between the body size and drowning
Another lifeguard who knows the relationship between the water splashing and drowning
Our eyes are powerful and they can do all this at the same time, but we need to teach machines
